# Baseball-Stats

This program is about the hitting stats from the 2021 MLB season for every player from all 30 teams. All stats are from the regular season and does not reflect the pre and post season let alone the all star game. During the mib-season trade, many players have stats from 2 different teams. In this program you should be able to view a few charts. In time I would like to complete this program by incorporating a user interface to select inofmation by team, player, and/or position.

All of the data has been taken fron the 'www.baseball-reference.com' website.

In this program I have been using Visual Studio Code.
